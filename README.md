# MNIST_ML

This repo is to store all the possible ways to identify handwritten numbers from a medium-sized sample of data, namely the very famous MNIST dataset. These are 28x28 images (i.e. a 784-dimension vector) which are given as input, where the algorithm learns how to analyse the images by using a backpropagation based approach (ANN) and determine the set of weights and biases which gives the highest accuracy for this training set. 

This code is not optimised, and there are much better approaches - which will be added soon enough.
